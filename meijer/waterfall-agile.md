# Waterfall vs. Agile
Waterfall and Agile are both methodologies for organizing the work of software development. Both present benefits over the other and it's up to the project manager to decide which one is best to use for each specific project. 

## **Waterfall Style**  
Often referred to as traditional style, waterfall offers a more linear approach in software dev. This type of models offers a step by step development starting from:

1. **Conception**: creates the overall requirements and documents for the project. 
2. **Design**: plan out proper design steps to effectively complete project.
3. **Code and Unit Test**: coding features and testing them, making sure they are bug free.
4. **System Testing**: make sure new features do not have any conflict of interest with previously working features.
5. **User Acceptance Testing**: shows almost completed feature to users and accepts feedback and additional things to work on.
6. **Fix Issues**
7. **Deliver**

In this traditional style, each step is fully and thoroughly completed before going onto the next. There can also be a gap of time in between each step, just to verify all requirements have been met and the project is ready to move on. 

| Pros | Cons |
|---------|---------|
| Planning is straightforward as a list of requirements are laid out in the beginning. This allows for developers to have a sense of how much work is required, and for multiple developers to work on the project simultaneously. | Requirements gathered in early stages of the project are almost certainly going to fall short. As the project develops and customers are able to see more of their project come to life, they may have changed opinons about specific features. | 
| Elminates the likelihood of _peacemeal effect_, where bits of code that may not fit well together is continuously added as the project goes on. With the long design portion, devs can efficiently plan out code that will be used in the future. | It is totally possible for customers to be dissatisfied with the end product, at which point it may be too costly to reimplement. Customers must stick close to their first draft of a specific project, which may not always be the best. |

## **Agile**
Agile aims to be more team-based and is a more iterative approach to development. The entire end product need not be totally finalized at the start of the project, as an agile environment focuses on implementing functional components in short time spurts or _sprints_. For each sprint, a few tasks and functions are prioritized to be finished, and the project slowly takes its form after many sprints. An agile environment also requires constant communication between developers and customers, as code is pushed daily and reviewed by project team members and customers. This way, with version control, it's very easy to start over and not lose a lot of work. Also, code is constantly tested and feedback loops are prominent, helping catch major bugs in case they escape to production.

| Pros | Cons |
|---------|---------|
| The customer has a lot of opportunities to make changes and add features to the project as they see it become developed.  | Requires huge amounts of dedication to the project from team members and consumers alike. | 
| Agile allows for a basic working backbone of an application that can be iteratively worked on and added to. | Because features are constantly being added, planning has to be done perfectly or some items may not be completed during their allotted time. |
